            <h2>About Web Dev</h2>
            <p> <h4> What is Web Development?</h4><br>
                Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications that are accessed over the internet or 
                an intranet. <br>It involves a variety of tasks, including web design, web content creation, client-side/server-side scripting, and network security configuration. <br>
                There are three main types of web development: front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development. <br>
                Front-end development focuses on the visual aspects and user interaction of a website, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
                 Back-end development deals with the server-side, including databases and server logic, using languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java.<br>
                  Full-stack development combines both front-end and back-end tasks, requiring a versatile skill set. <br>
                  Key elements of web development include HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic content.<br>
                   Responsive design ensures websites function well on various devices, while web hosting provides the necessary storage space. <br>
                   Web security is crucial to protect against cyber threats. Tools like Git enable version control, and modern trends like Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), Single Page Applications (SPAs),<br>
                    WebAssembly, and serverless architecture are shaping the future of web development. Staying updated with these trends and best practices is essential for creating efficient, secure,<br>
                     and user-friendly web applications.
