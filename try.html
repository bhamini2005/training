    <h1>Cricket</h1>
    <p>Cricket is my favorite sport in the world. It is played by everyone in my school and every <br>
        school in the country. It is the most exciting game in the country, and everybody loves watching<br> cricket matches.
         Indian people have so much zest for cricket that they can play it anywhere – in small fields,<br>
          roads, gullies, and anywhere they can bowl and bat! I never get tired of playing cricket, and it is the only game <br>
          we play after school and during the holidays</p>

     <h1>Football</h1> 
     <p>Football, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their<br>
        hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper is <br>
        permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal.<br>
         The team that scores more goals wins.</p>
